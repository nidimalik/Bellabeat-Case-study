Collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, and reproductive health has allowed Bellabeat to empower women with knowledge about their own health and habits.\n\nSince it was founded in 2013, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly\npositioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for women.\n\n# Main Business Task\nto analyze smart device usage data in order to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices. \nmain questions guiding the analysis process:\n\n* What are some trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n# Stakeholders\n\n* Urška Sršen: Cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat\n* Sando Mur: Bellabeat’s co founder and key member of the Bellabeat executive team\n* Bellabeat marketing analytics team: responsible for collecting, analyzing, and reporting data that helps guide Bellabeat’s marketing strategy.\n\n\n# About our data\n\nWe will be using FitBit Fitness Tracker Data data set made available through Mobius. <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit>\n\nthe data is open sourced.This Kaggle data set contains personal fitness tracker from thirty fitbit users. \nThirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.\n\nhowever keeping in mind the limits our of dataset i.e it only provides a limited number of samples for us to work with as well as the fact that the data was only recorded for a time period of two months. It is possible that there might be some form of bias present in the data.\n\n# ROCCC analysis\n* Reliability : LOW – dataset was collected from 30 individuals whose gender is unknown.\n* Originality : LOW – third party data collect using Amazon Mechanical Turk.\n* Comprehensive : MEDIUM – dataset contains multiple fields on daily activity intensity, calories used, daily steps taken, daily sleep time and weight record.\n* Current : MEDIUM – data is 7 years old but the habit of how people live does not change over a few years\n* Cited : HIGH – data collector and source is well documented\n\n# Preparing the data\nWe are using R to analyze this data as it is easier to work with large datasets in R.\nNow we are downloading some packages to ensure that we have necessary tools for analysing our

The company will have a good idea on how customers are using their product during the day. Most users are active before and after work, I suppose. The company can use this time in the Bellabeat app to remind and motivate users to go for a run or for a walk.\n\n# Conclusion and Business Recomendation\nSo, collecting data on activity, sleep, stress, etc. will allow the company Bellabeat to empower the customers with knowledge about their own health and daily habits. The company Bellabeat is growing rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for their customers.\n\nBy analyzing the FitBit Fitness Tracker Data set, I found some insights that would help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy.\n\n# Target Audience\n\nPeople working full-time jobs and spending a lot of time at the computer and in the office and need fitness and daily activities to be in shape.\n\nThe users are doing some light activity to stay healthy (according to the activity type analysis). And they need to improve their everyday activity to have more health benefits. And they might need some knowledge about developing healthy habits and motivation to keep them going.\n\n# Recomendation for the marketing team\n\n* The sedentary time for users is quite high (16 hours approximately). this needs to reduced by promoting a more health lifestyle. the marketing team should collaborate with celebrates to promote a new target oriented feature for the company's app with a reward system.\n\n* Participants sleep 1 time for an average of 7 hours. To help users improve their sleep, Bellabeat should consider a sleep reminder feature that reminds users to go to bed. this might also help the Bellabeat app in reducing sedentary time as a well rested user would likely exersise more.\n\n* The average total steps per day (which is 7638) is a little bit less than recommended by the CDC. According to the CDC research, taking 8,000 steps per day was associated with a 51% lower risk for all-cause mortality (or death from all causes). And taking 12,000 steps per day was associated with a 65% lower risk compared with taking 4,000 steps. So, Bellabeat can encourage people to take at least 8,000 steps per day by explaining the healthy benefits of doing that.\n\n* By analyzing the Intensity data over time. The company will have a good idea on how their customers are using their app during the day. Most users are active before and after work. The company can use this time in the Bellabeat app to remind and motivate users to go for a run or for a walk.\n\n* For customers who want to lose weight, it can be a good idea to control daily calorie consumption. And Bellabeat can partner with chefs to add simple, inclusive and low calorie food recommendations for their users.\n\nThank you very much for your interest in my Bellabeat Case Study!\n\nAnd I would appreciate any comments and recommendations for improvement!","metadata":{}}]}
